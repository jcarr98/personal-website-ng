When the butter is distributed, transfer the mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan. Place the pan in the refrigerator while you work on the additional layers. Mix the cream cheese with a mixer until light and fluffy. Add in 2 tablespoons of milk and sugar, and mix well. Stir in 1 and 1/4 cups of cool whip. Spread this mixture over the crust. In a bowl, combine chocolate instand pudding with 3 and 1/4 cups cold milk. Whisk for several minutes until the pudding starts to thicken. Use a spatula to spread the mixture over the previous cream cheese layer. Allow the dessert to rest for about 5 minutes so that the pudding can firm up further. Spread the remaining cool whip over the top. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips, walnuts, almonds, whatever you choose evenly over teh top. Place in the freezer for 1 hour, or the refrigerator for 4 hours before serving"

If the batter is very thick, add another 2-3 tablespoons of milk to make it more pourable. Place the batter into a well greased 4-6 quart slow cooker. Now for the chocolate fudge sauce: combine all ingredients with 1 cup of boiling water and whisk together into a thin chocolate liquid. Pour this over the top of the peanut butter batter in the crock; DO NOT STIR TOGETHER. Cover the cooker and \"bake\" on high for 2-3 hours"

Add to flour mixture, along with the eggs. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the bowl. Beat on high 3 minutes. Stir in at least two more cups of flour, adding more until the dough is stiff. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3-5 minutes total). Shape dough into a ball. Place in a greased bowl, turn once; cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Divide in half; cover. Let sit for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease two 9-by-1 1/2 inch round baking pans. For filling, stir together brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour and cinnamon. Cut in 1/3 cup butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Roll each half of dough into a 12x8-inch rectangle. Sprinkle filling over dough rectangles. Scatter with raisins and pecans, if using. Roll up each rectangle starting from a long side. Seal seams. Slice each roll into 12 pieces. Place cut sides down in prepared pans. Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap, leaving room for the rolls to rise. Chill for 2-24 hours; uncover. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes; This will produce the best flavor. However, if you want to bake the rolls right away (an really, who wants to wait 24 hours for delicious cinnamon rolls?) don't chill the dough. Instead, cover loosely, let dough rise in a warm place until nearly double, about 30 minutes. When ready to bake, brush dough with half-and-half. Bake at 375 degrees, 20-25 minutes or until light brown. While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, stir together the powdered sugar, corn syrup, and vanilla. Add enough half-and-half to reach drizzling consistency. When the rolls are done, remove from oven and set on a wire rack for 1 minute. Drizzle with vanilla glaze. Serve warm (with good, strong coffee)"
