            <nb-tab tabTitle="About Me">
                <p>
                    I am a senior year computer science major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with an interest in cybersecurity. I am a participant in UMass's Scholarship for Service program. Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-carr/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>!

                    I've been interested in computers since I was in middle school when I started playing video games and though it was amazing what you could do on a computer. Freshman year of high school, I started a programming 
                    club as a place where students could collaborate and learn about programming since our school didn't offer much in terms of software development. Since then, I've learned a lot about programming concepts and languages 
                    as well as how computers actually work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my part time I like to play around with projects trying to learn new skills. I also enjoy playing sports, mostly intramural flag football and basketball with my friends, and love any way I can get my energy out. In my
                    sophomore year of college, I started a video game development club because I wanted to learn the skills I needed to create something fun for others to enjoy. To this day, the club has about 15 active members and 62 people in
                    our Discord server.

                    Another great place to learn stuff about me is this <a href="https://jeffjeanusa.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> that my mom created during our drive across the country. This is the second time we've
                    done a trip like this and I feel very luck to have that opportunity. This was a very important trip for me, so having the blog to memorialize it is amazing.
